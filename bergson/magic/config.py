    - 'all' saves every checkpoint. This method uses O(N) space and O(N) time.

      segment. Training is recursively divided into segments. This method uses O(log N)
      space and O(N log N) time.
    - 'sqrt' saves at a linearly-spaced interval, every sqrt(N) steps. This method uses
      O(sqrt N) space and O(N) time.

    The original MAGIC paper used 'log', but 'sqrt' is often a better choice when disk
    space is not a concern.
