# Bergson
This library enables you to trace the memory of deep neural nets with gradient-based data attribution techniques. We currently focus on TrackStar, as described in [Scalable Influence and Fact Tracing for Large Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17413v3) by Chang et al. (2024), although we plan to add support for other methods inspired by influence functions in the near future.

We view attribution as a counterfactual question: **_If we "unlearned" this training sample, how would the model's behavior change?_** This formulation ties attribution to some notion of what it means to "unlearn" a training sample. Here we focus on a very simple notion of unlearning: taking a gradient _ascent_ step on the loss with respect to the training sample. To mimic the behavior of popular optimizers, we precondition the gradient using Adam or Adafactor-style estimates of the second moments of the gradient.

# Installation

We're not yet on PyPI, but you can `git clone` the repo and install it as a package using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EleutherAI/bergson.git
cd bergson
pip install .
```

# Usage
The first step is to build an index of gradients for each training sample. You can do this from the command line, using `bergson` as a CLI tool:

```bash
bergson <output_path> --model <model_name> --dataset <dataset_name>
```

This will create a directory at `<output_path>` containing the gradients for each training sample in the specified dataset. The `--model` and `--dataset` arguments should be compatible with the Hugging Face `transformers` library. By default it assumes that the dataset has a `text` column, but you can specify other columns using `--prompt_column` and optionally `--completion_column`. The `--help` flag will show you all available options.

You can also use the library programmatically to build the index. The `collect_gradients` function is just a bit lower level the CLI tool, and allows you to specify the model and dataset directly as arguments. The result is a HuggingFace dataset which contains a handful of new columns, including `gradients`, which contains the gradients for each training sample. You can then use this dataset to compute attributions.

At the lowest level of abstraction, the `GradientCollector` context manager allows you to efficiently collect gradients for _each individual example_ in a batch during a backward pass, simultaneously randomly projecting the gradients to a lower-dimensional space to save memory. If you use Adafactor normalization, which is the default, we will do this in a very compute-efficient way which avoids computing the full gradient for each example before projecting it to the lower dimension. There are two main ways you can use `GradientCollector`:

1. Using a `closure` argument, which enables you to make use of the per-example gradients immediately after they are computed, during the backward pass. If you're computing summary statistics or other per-example metrics, this is the most efficient way to do it.
2. Without a `closure` argument, in which case the gradients are collected and returned as a dictionary mapping module names to batches of gradients. This is the simplest and most flexible approach but is a bit more memory-intensive.

## Training Gradients

Gradient collection during training is supported via an integration with HuggingFace's Trainer and SFTTrainer classes. Training gradients are saved in the original order corresponding to their dataset items, and when the `track_order` flag is set the training steps associated with each training item are separately saved.

```python
from bergson import GradientCollectorCallback, prepare_for_gradient_collection

callback = GradientCollectorCallback(
    path="runs/example",
    track_order=True,
    use_optimizer_state=False,
)
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    eval_dataset=dataset,
    callbacks=[callback],
)
trainer = prepare_for_gradient_collection(trainer)
trainer.train()
```

## Attention Head Gradients

By default Bergson collects gradients for named parameter matrices, but gradients for individual attention heads within a named matrix can be collected too. To collect head gradients add a `head_cfgs` dictionary to the training calllback or static index config.

```python
from bergson import HeadConfig, IndexConfig, DataConfig
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("RonenEldan/TinyStories-1M", trust_remote_code=True, use_safetensors=True)

collect_gradients(
    model=model,
    data=data,
    processor=processor,
    path="runs/example_with_heads",
    head_cfgs={
        # Head configuration for the TinyStories-1M transformer
        "h.0.attn.attention.out_proj": HeadConfig(num_heads=16, head_size=4, head_dim=2),
    },
)
```

## GRPO

Where a reward signal is available we compute gradients using a weighted advantage estimate based on Dr. GRPO:

```bash
bergson <output_path> --model <model_name> --dataset <dataset_name> --reward_column <reward_column_name>
```

## Queries

We provide a query Attributor which supports unit normalized gradients and KNN search out of the box.

```
from bergson import Attributor, FaissConfig

attr = Attributor(args.index, device="cuda")

...
query_tokens = tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")["input_ids"]

# Query the index
with attr.trace(model.base_model, 5) as result:
    model(query_tokens, labels=query_tokens).loss.backward()
    model.zero_grad()
```

To efficiently query on-disk indexes, perform ANN searches, and explore many other scalability features add a FAISS config:

```
attr = Attributor(args.index, device="cuda", faiss_cfg=FaissConfig("IVF1,SQfp16", mmap_index=True))

with attr.trace(model.base_model, 5) as result:
    model(query_tokens, labels=query_tokens).loss.backward()
    model.zero_grad()
```

# Development

pip install -e .[dev]
