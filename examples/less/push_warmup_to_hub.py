"""Upload LESS warmup checkpoints to a HF repo as Pythia-style revisions.

Each warmup ``checkpoint-*`` directory becomes its own branch on a single
HuggingFace repo. The branch name is derived from the trainer's epoch at that
checkpoint, e.g. ``epoch-1``, ``epoch-2``. Optionally also force-updates
``main`` to point at the final epoch.

Run:
    python -m examples.less.push_warmup_to_hub \
        --warmup_path runs/less/Llama-2-7b-hf<...>/warmup \
        --repo_id EleutherAI/less-replication-7b-warmup
