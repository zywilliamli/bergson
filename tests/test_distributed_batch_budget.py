"""Distributed bin-packing + pad must not exceed the per-rank token budget.

Regression test for a NCCL-collective-shaped deadlock observed in the LESS
pipeline FSDP train builds: ``pad_and_tensor`` does an ``all_reduce(MAX)``
on sequence length and pads every rank's batch to the global max.
Combined with bergson's bin-packing (which only enforces the budget per
batch *in isolation*), a rank that gets a single long-example batch can
force every other rank at the same iteration index to pad many short
examples up to that long length, blowing the per-batch token budget by
~40× and OOM-thrashing the GPU.

This test runs on CPU via gloo so it doesn't need a multi-GPU node.
